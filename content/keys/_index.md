These keys are attached to this page and are available on SKS server. You should
verify the fingerprints of these keys using some other channel than just this
page (e.g. my Gitlab & Github account).

This page is generated using the data at:
    https://gitlab.com/roddhjav/roddhjav.gitlab.io/raw/master/data/keys.yml.
It has been signed with my master key and may be verified using the
[public key]. If you have trust in that key, you can verify that this page has
not been tampered by downloading the file:
    https://pujol.io/keys/keys.yml.asc
and running the command: `gpg --verify keys.yml.asc`

[public key]: /keys/0xe0cc7d788da0ebf2.asc
